Dragon curve from paper folding sequence

Dragon curves, the binary paper folding sequence , actual paper folding.

Which is pretty easy to fold the wrong way.

I have made this curve using L-systems before, this time I have made it with the binary paper folding sequence. This is the 12th iteration and it is a binary number with 4095 digits.

If it is a "1" the turtle goes left, if "0" the turtle goes right.

I read Jurassic park, I didn't remember this curve was in the book. Some good Numberphile videos about it too.

I found these resources the most helpful:
https://mathworld.wolfram.com/DragonCurve.html
wolfram has a list of references, and a description of a simple method to create
the paper folding sequence.

Check out Larry Riddles page he has a really informative discussion of this and other fractals. And even more references to articles!
