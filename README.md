Dragon curve from paper folding sequence

Dragon curves, the binary paper folding sequence , actual paper folding.

Which is pretty easy to fold the wrong way.

I have made this curve using L-systems before, this time I have made it with the binary paper folding sequence. This is the 12th iteration and it is a binary number with 4095 digits.

If it is a "1" the turtle goes left, if "0" the turtle goes right.

I read Jurassic park, I didn't remember this curve was in the book. Some good Numberphile videos about it too.

I am not generating the paper folding sequence in the sketch.

I have the paper folding sequence for the 12 iteration which has 4095 binary digits.

I can get any level from one to 12 by taking (2**N)-1.  The paper folding sequence for level 3 is (2**3)-1 = 7 digits long.

the level is mapped to the mouse X movement

## nice quote about fractals from the fictional character Ian Malcom:
> A day is like a whole life. You start out doing one thing, but end up doing something else, plan to run an errand, but never get there... And at the end of your life, > your whole existence has that same haphazard quality, too. Your whole life has the same shape as a single day.”

I found these resources the most helpful:

wolfram has a list of references, and a description of a simple method to create
the paper folding sequence.

Check out Larry Riddles page he has a really informative discussion of this and other fractals. And even more references to articles!
